# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in StudyRabbit, we encourage you to responsibly disclose it to us. We will make every effort to resolve the issue in a timely manner. 

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to [security@trystudyrabbit.com] with a detailed description of the issue.

Please do not use GitHub issues or pull requests to disclose security vulnerabilities.

## Accepted Vulnerabilities
We are particularly interested in vulnerabilities that could compromise:
- User data (e.g., unauthorized access, leakage, or theft of sensitive data)
- Authentication/authorization processes
- Code execution vulnerabilities
- Denial of service attacks

## Response Time
We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours. Our team will work quickly to assess the issue and provide an estimated timeline for resolution. Critical issues will be addressed within 72 hours, while lower priority issues may take longer.

## Safe Disclosure
Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will acknowledge your contribution by adding your name to our list of contributors, unless you request to remain anonymous. We will also coordinate with you for a public disclosure of the vulnerability, if appropriate, once the fix is deployed.
